## scrape
Scraping done with [scalpel](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/scalpel).
Currently using [wreq](http://www.serpentine.com/wreq/) for HTTP'ing; might switch if something else makes it easier to parallelize

## ~~tokenize~~
(TK)
Probably [chatter](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/chatter)'s POS tagger, unless I find something better

## ~~store~~
(TK)
Uh...[mysql-simple](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/mysql-simple)??? I guess???

## TODO
- [ ] figure out storage
- [ ] tests
